# IndoorMaps

User roles:
-Map Creator
  -As a map creator you can design and publish maps, ideally completely within the software. In the minimum version of this website the map creation will consist of drawing the outline of the building on top of a digital map (maybe openStreeMaps), and then adding areas with names and descriptions inside of the buildings borders. 
  -Nice to have would be the ability to upload an existing image of the map that then could be used to aid the drawing.
  -User Personas:
    -Mr. Smith is a Principal of a High School and finds that students have a hard time finding their classes on the first day of school.
    -Jacob runs a local supermarket and is worried that his customers will want to shop at walmart because of their inhouse product finding software
-Map Viewer
  -As a map viewer you can see your location inside the building and where you are in relation to the mapped out rooms and areas. 
  -You will be able to search for rooms and then generate directions to a specific location.
